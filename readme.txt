Plugin to add a simple menu item under the Plugins menu to take the admin user directly to the update plugins page

== Description ==

This plugin simply moves the Plugin admin menu items down and makes 'Available Updates' the primary link. This is very useful if you have a lot of sites needing plugin updates, as it saves 3 mouse clicks per site. It adds up! Added step to take admin login directly to the available updates page, saving another click! If there are no plugin updates pending then clicking on the menu item just takes you to the list of installed plugins.

== Installation ==

Use WordPress' Add New Plugin feature, searching "Available Updates", or download the archive and:

1. Unzip the archive on your computer
2. Upload `available-updates` directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. New menu item should appear under 'Plugins' menu at the first level

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why mess with the menu structure? =

After about 20 websites all needing to be checked for updates on a regular basis, I was tired of so many mouse clicks and since this seemed to be a more common admin task it made sense that it should be top most on the menu system if there were updates to be done. So here you are, saving about 3 mouse clicks per WordPress install. 

You're welcome!

== Screenshots ==

1. The typical way to get to the 'Update Available' admin menu option

2. The existing menu is pushed down and now "Available Updates" is top most
